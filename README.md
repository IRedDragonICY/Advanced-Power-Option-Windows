# Basic Option

## Require a Password on wakeup 
Require a password to unlock the computer when it wakes from sleep.
Parameter:

Yes *Will required password*

No *Automatically unlock to desktop*

## Device idle policy
Specifies the policy for devices powering down while the system is running.
Parameter:

Performance **It will ignoore idle mode**

Power Savings **Prioritize idle mode**

## Disconnected Standby Mode
Specifies the disconnected standby mode.
Parameter:
Normal **Computer will prioritize C3 (Sleep) than C1/C2**
Aggresive  **Prioritize C1/C2**

## Networking connectivity in Standby
Specifies network connection state in standby.
Parameter:

Disable **Network will disconnected if in standby mode**

Enable **Network will keep**

Managed by Windows **Automate by Windows**
